This is a talk I did at the [IntentHQ Summit 2022](https://intenthq.com/) about some of the terminal tools and commands I use as a developer.

## Presentation

The slides for the presentation are generated with [marp](https://marp.app/). If you want to obtain a pdf version of them, make sure you have marp installed and run `make` from the presentation directory

## Stow modules

`git` `tmux` and `vim` contain configuration files. They are meant to be used with GNU stow. Please refer to the presentation for more detailed info.

### Acknoledgements

The idea of using stow and the vim configuration files structure are heavily based on [this article](http://oli.me.uk/2015/06/17/wrangling-javascript-with-vim/), with some of code literally copied from [Olical's dotfiles](https://github.com/Olical/dotfiles)
